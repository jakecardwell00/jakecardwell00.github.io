**Duration:** August 2025 – December 2025  
**Role:** Co-Lead Designer & Avionics Lead  
**Context:** AAE 451 competition with strict volume and performance constraints

## Overview
Co-led the design, build, and flight testing of a **remotely piloted fixed-wing aircraft** for Purdue's Design-Build-Fly competition. Optimized the aircraft for structural integrity, aerodynamics, and manufacturability within a **75×75×150 cm** volume constraint while meeting mission requirements for takeoff, climb, and soft landing.

## Key Contributions

### 1. CAD Design & Structural Analysis
- Developed complete **SolidWorks assembly** for competition aircraft
- Performed **wing loading analysis** and **shear/bending moment calculations**
- Optimized spar placement and material selection (aluminum vs. carbon fiber trade study)

*Complete aircraft CAD assembly*

### 2. Stability & Aerodynamic Analysis
- Created **scissor plots** to analyze longitudinal and lateral stability
- Determined optimal **center of gravity bounds** (6-22% chord)
- Selected airfoils: **MH 32** (wing) and **NACA 0012** (tail surfaces)

### 3. Structural Validation
- Calculated **bending moments** across wing spans under flight loads
- Validated structural integrity through iterative analysis
- Selected **¾" aluminum square spar** for optimal strength-to-weight

### 4. Avionics Integration & Flight Testing
- Spearheaded **avionics placement strategy** to minimize electromagnetic interference
- Ensured precise **IMU alignment** with aircraft principal axes
- Conducted flight testing at McAllister airfield, validating takeoff, climb, and landing performance

## Technical Specifications
- **Wingspan:** 1.48 m (within 1.50 m limit)
- **MTOW:** 5.28 kg (51.0 N)
- **Power System:** Cobra 3525/12 motor, 6S LiPo, APC 15×4E propeller
- **Takeoff Distance:** 23.95 m (25 m requirement)
- **Climb Altitude:** 30.37 m (30 m requirement)

## Outcome
- Successfully designed, built, and **flight-tested competition-ready aircraft**
- Met **7 of 8** RFP requirements (exceeded budget by 31.4%)
- Applied **aerospace engineering principles** to practical design constraints
- Developed **leadership in technical project management** within team environment
