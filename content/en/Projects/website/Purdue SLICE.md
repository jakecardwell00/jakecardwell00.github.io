## Overview
Engineered the **CAD system** for a human-tended, zero-gravity fluid experiment as part of Purdue's spaceflight research initiative with **Virgin Galactic**. Designed composite test vessels and automated fluid control systems for microgravity conditions.

**Duration:** August 2025 – December 2025  
**Role:** CAD & Systems Engineer  
**Context:** Virgin Galactic collaboration for zero-gravity research

## Key Contributions

### 1. CAD System Design
- Created detailed **Siemens NX models** for the complete fluid experiment assembly
- Ensured system integrity for vibration and pressure loads during launch and flight

*Full system CAD model for zero-gravity fluid experiment*

### 2. Automated Fluid Control
- Programmed **Arduino-based control system** for 300mL flow-through operation
- Tested flowrate through **pressure sensors** for precise fluid management

*Pressurized flow test results validating system performance*

### 3. Structural Analysis & Testing
- In the process of conducting **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** on composite structures for the box
- Optimized material selection for weight, strength, and manufacturability

## Technical Notes
*Note: Full technical report and detailed findings are not publicly available due to research collaboration agreements with Virgin Galactic and Purdue's spaceflight initiative.*
