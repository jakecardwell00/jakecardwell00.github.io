## Overview
Designed and built a **fully remote-controlled golf cart** from scratch, combining hardware fabrication, electronics integration, and custom software. The project implemented wireless control, motor driving, and sensor feedback for autonomous movement capabilities.

**Duration:** June 2024 – August 2024  
**Role:** Hardware & Software Developer  
**Context:** Personal project with remote collaborator

## Key Components & Development

### 1. Hardware Fabrication
- Designed and **3D-printed controller and cut chassis components**
- Machined mounting brackets and structural supports
- **Welded** aluminum plates for body

*Completed remote-controlled golf cart with custom body*

### 2. Electronics Integration
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino Uno with custom C++ firmware
- **Motor Control:** BTS7960 high-current motor drivers
- **Wireless Communication:** nRF24L01 2.4GHz transceiver modules
- **Sensors:** MPU-6050 motion tracking (gyro + accelerometer)
