## Overview
As a Propulsion Engineer on Purdue's Hybrid Rocket Team, I designed and manufactured **aluminum rocket components** for a 15-ft rocket targeting **50,000 ft altitude**. Contributed to propulsion system design, simulation, and manufacturing.

**Duration:** September 2024 – May 2025  
**Role:** Propulsion Engineer  
**Tools:** Fusion 360 CAM, Simulation, MATLAB

## Key Contributions

### 1. CAM Manufacturing
- Designed and programmed **Fusion 360 CAM** toolpaths for aluminum flight components
- Optimized machining parameters for aerospace-grade aluminum alloys
- Produced precision parts meeting structural and weight requirements
