## Overview
During my summer internship at **Rainmaker Technology**, I worked as a Systems Engineering Intern on UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) aerosol dispersion systems. My primary focus was designing and integrating the **compressor impeller** for drones used in large-scale cloud seeding and atmospheric research projects.

**Duration:** May 2025 – August 2025  
**Role:** Systems Engineering Intern  
**Tools Used:** SolidWorks, GD&T, SimScale CFD, 3D Printing, Raspberry Pi

## Key Contributions

### 1. Compressor Impeller Design & Manufacturing Coordination
- Designed high-efficiency impeller blades for UAV aerosol dispersion
- Created **aerospace-grade technical drawings** with full GD&T (Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing)
- Coordinated with manufacturing vendors for a **$60K production order** of ~120 units
- Ensured tolerances met flight-worthy standards for drones operating at varied altitudes
